# Staff Guidelines

### These rules apply to *all* staff members. Breaking them *will* get you fired!

1. **Do *not* leak *any* information about staff restricted topics and similar.**

All conversations between staff members, WIP plans for the server, etc. is considered private and confidential. Do not, *under any circumstances*, disclose any of this material beyond the staff group.

2. **Don't break the rules**

As a staff member, you must follow the *same* rules as everyone else. Always set a good example to other players, ensuring your messages are family friendly.

3. **Be polite**

You are representing the SecurityCraft server. Please keep this in mind when interacting with other players. Make sure that you're *always* aiming to help users, treating them in an appropriate and polite manner at all times. Don't be overly nice, though, since this could be interpreted as sarcasm, arrogance or similar.

4. **Respect administrators**

Administrators are your superiors. Treat them with respect, do not accuse them of anything or insult them. Although we are nice people and sometimes turn a blind eye on specific situations, not following this rule will get you fired immediately.

5. **Don't abuse or brag about your position**

Please use the tools you have been given wisely. Moderative action for personal gain is strictly forbidden. *Never* use your position as leverage over other members. Please don't go out of your way to brag about it.

6. ***Never* moderate issues you're directly affiliated with**

This includes, but is not limited to: Griefs of your own property, rule breaks done by family/friends etc. and insults against you.

7. **Behave well everywhere else, too**

Your ingame name will probably be connected to other accounts across the internet, too. Please take this into consideration when conducting yourself online. Your representation on this server extends to all other environments that share the same account details.
