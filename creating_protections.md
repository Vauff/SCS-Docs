# Creating Protections

The server uses FoxGuard to protect different server and player buildings. FoxGuard is different from most protection plugins in the way that it doesn't simply use regions, you have to combine a handler and a worldregion (region) to create what would be considered a region in another protection plugin like WorldGuard.
