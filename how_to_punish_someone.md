# How to Punish Someone

## Commands

If you've only warned someone then just skip to the Documenting secion. But if you need to ban someone you'll need to use either the /tempban or /ban command depending on the situation and severity of the offence (See [Severity of Offences](https://github.com/Vauff/SCS-Docs/blob/master/severity_of_offences.md)). The syntax to the commands are as follows.

- /tempban \<user> \<duration> \<reason>
- /ban \<user> \<reason>

Don't forget to add "appeal at https://goo.gl/JeQ8FR" to the end of your ban reasons. 

## Documenting

After banning or warning someone you need to document it on the [Offenders Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18UH0hVrdwSh8ZgKIilQaq9zRwub0gVpHvWFRQsAAW6g/edit?usp=drivesdk).

Below you will find a quick guide on how to fill in the spreadsheet correctly. 

- *Offender:* Fill in the payername of the warned or banned player. 
- *Date:* Fill in the date that the offender was warned/banned on in dd-mm-yyyy format.
- *Reason:* Select a valid reason in the dropdown menu. If the appropriate reason is not on the list or there are multiple reasons, select 'Other' or 'Multiple' and fill in the reason(s) in the 'Notes' column.
- *Punishment:* Select which punishment you gave from the dropdown menu. If the punishment you gave is not on the list or multiple punishments were handed out, select 'Other' or 'Multiple' and fill in the punishment(s) in the 'Notes' column.
- *Issuer:* Fill in the name of the issuer in this column. 
- *Notes:* Add additional information in this column.

**BAN APPEALS ARE TO BE REPORTED TO THE ADMINS TO DEAL WITH**
